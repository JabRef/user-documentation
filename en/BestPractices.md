# Helpful groups

- Group for your own papers: `author=YOURSELF`
- Group for the papers of your group: `author=YOURSELF and author=COLLEAGUE1 and author=COLLEAGUE2`

# Sort order

Sort your entries with the `bibtexkey` on save (can be set in the database properties). This makes finding an entry easier in a large file. 

# Use Integrity Check often

Use `Quality -> Integrity Check` often to ensure that the quality of your database does not degrade. 

# Enable save actions

Specify your save actions (can be set in the database properties). This ensures that your bibtex file will look more consistent.
