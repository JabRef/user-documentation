# Field content selector

This feature allows you to store a selection of often-used words or phrases that you use often in your database. By default it is enabled for the fields *Journal*, *Author*, *Keywords* and *Publisher*, but you can also add selectors to other fields, in the upper part of the *Manage* dialog (menu **Tools --&gt; Manage content selectors**).

The word selection is database-specific, and is saved along with your references in the .bib file.

To add a new word, you can simply write it into the selector combo box and press Enter. Using the *Manage* dialog you can also remove words that you have added.
