# Fetching entries from DOAJ

[DOAJ (Directory of Open Access Journals)](http://doaj.org/) is a database covering more than 10000 open access journals covering all areas of science, technology, medicine, social science and humanities ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directory_of_Open_Access_Journals)).

To fetch entries from DOAJ, choose **Search -&gt; Web search**, and the search interface will appear in the side pane. Select **DOAJ** in the dropdown menu. To start a search, enter the words of your query, and press **Enter** or the **Fetch** button.

The results are displayed in the [import inspection window](ImportInspectionDialog).
In case an error occurs, it is shown in a popup.

It is possible to limit the search by adding a field name to the search, as **field:text**. The supported fields area:

-   title: The title of the article
-   doi: The DOI of the article
-   issn: The ISSN of the journal
-   publisher: The publisher of the journal
-   abstract: The abstract of the article
