#### I want to start with something easy [![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/JabRef/jabref](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/JabRef/jabref)

We collect **small issues** at GitHub in JabRef's [main repository](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/labels/good%20first%20issue) and also in [Koppor's repository](https://github.com/koppor/jabref/labels/good%20first%20issue). In case you do not find something suitable, you are invited to get in touch with us. Post in an issue you find interesting, check [the forum](https://discourse.jabref.org) or join our [chatting channel](https://gitter.im/JabRef/jabref).

After finding something, please check our [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed information and further links.

#### I want something with huge impact [![Discourse](https://img.shields.io/badge/discourse-online-green.svg)](https://discourse.jabref.org/c/features/6)

Look at the discussions in our forum about [new features](https://discourse.jabref.org/c/features/6). Find an interesting topic, discuss it and start contributing. Alternatively, you can check out [JabRefs projects page at GitHub](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/projects?type=classic). The projects page has the advantage that these issues have already been screened by the team and sorted into roughly high, moderate and low priority. Of course, in principle, all issues are free to take, but be aware that the difficulty of bugs and features varies.

#### I am a student or lecturer [![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/JabRef/jabref](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/JabRef/jabref)

JabRef offers special support to students and lecturers. In addition to small issues, check out [JabRefs candidates for university projects](https://github.com/orgs/JabRef/projects/3). For the brave and experienced (e.g. Master Students), the [bug board](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/projects/5) or the [feature board](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/projects/7) may turn out to be other pre-sorted issue sources.

If you ask yourself how to integrate JabRef into your class, please read the [documentation about how to integrate JabRef into a class of software engineering training](https://devdocs.jabref.org/teaching.html#jabref-and-software-engineering-training). As student, you may notify your lecturer about this possibility.
