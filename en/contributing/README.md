**I want something with huge impact** [![Discourse](https://img.shields.io/badge/discourse-online-green.svg)](https://discourse.jabref.org/c/features/6)

Look at the discussions in our forum about [new features](https://discourse.jabref.org/c/features/6). Find an interesting topic, discuss it and start contributing. Alternatively, you can check out [JabRefs projects page at GitHub](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/projects?query=is%3Aopen). Although, of course, you can choose to work on ANY issue, choosing from the projects page has the advantage that these issues have already been categorized, sorted and screened by JabRef maintainers. A typical sub-classifications scheme is "priority" (high, normal and low). Fixing high priority issues is preferred.


**I am a lecturer**

If you ask yourself how to integrate JabRef into your class, please read the [documentation about how to integrate JabRef into a class of software engineering training](https://devdocs.jabref.org/teaching.html#jabref-and-software-engineering-training). As student, you may notify your lecturer about this possibility.
