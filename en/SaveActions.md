# Save actions

Field formatting can be tidied up when saving the database.
That ensures your entries to have consistent formatting.
If you check **Enable save actions** in the [Database Properties](DatabaseProperties), the list of actions can be configured.

Each action is defined by:
- an entry field (upon which the action will be applied).
- the type of action to be carried out (such as *HTML to LaTeX*, which converts HTML code to LaTeX code, as described in the window).

Dependent on the database mode, "Recommended for BibTeX" or "Recommended for BibLaTeX".
When pressing this button, the recommended cleanups for the respective mode is called.

<!--

The list of formatters and explanations can be quickly generated with following command

/c/git-repositories/jabref/jabref/src/main/java/org/jabref/logic/formatter (master)
$ find . -name "*.java" | xargs grep "Localization.lang" | sed "s/.*Localization.lang(\"\(.*\)\");/## \1/"

...and a mit manual post-processing

## Add enclosing braces
Add braces encapsulating the complete field content.
For instance

    title = {Test with UPPERCASE word},

gets

    title = {{Test with UPPERCASE word}},

However, this procedure is not recommended.
It is better to use the "Protect Terms" functionality.
