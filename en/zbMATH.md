# Fetching entries from zbMATH

[zbMATH](https://www.zbmath.org/) is a reviewing service providing reviews and abstracts for articles in pure and applied mathematics ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zentralblatt_MATH)).


To fetch entries from zbMATH, choose **Search -&gt; Web search**, and the search interface will appear in the side pane.
Select **zbMATH** in the dropdown menu.
To start a search, enter the words of your query, and press <kdb>RETURN</kdb> or the **Fetch** button.

Then, the results are displayed in the [import inspection window](ImportInspectionDialog).
In case an error occurs, it is shown in a popup.
