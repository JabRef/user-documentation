## I am not a programmer


### I would like to improve the help page. What are the steps?

Please follow our [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/JabRef/help.jabref.org/blob/gh-pages/CONTRIBUTING.md) file.


### I would like to help translating JabRef to another language. How do I get started?

We encourage you to read about [translating JabRef](TranslatingGUI).


### I want to keep Wikipedia pages up-to-date

JabRef improves -- and Wikipedia pages should keep up!

Simply click on "Edit" (top right-hand tab).

Currently existing pages are:

- Deutsch: [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/JabRef](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/JabRef)
- English: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JabRef](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JabRef)
- Español: [https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/JabRef](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/JabRef)
- Français: [https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/JabRef](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/JabRef)

- Українська: [https://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/JabRef](https://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/JabRef)
