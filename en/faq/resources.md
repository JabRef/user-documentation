### JabRef journal abbreviation lists

JabRef can help you refactor your reference list by automatically abbreviating or unabbreviating journal names, as explained in [the dedicated help](https://docs.jabref.org/fields/journalabbreviations).

Although JabRef comes with a build-in list of journals, additional lists are available at [https://abbrv.jabref.org](https://abbrv.jabref.org).

### Export filters

JabRef allows you to create custom export filters. This functionality and the installation procedure are described in the help file on [Custom export filters](https://docs.jabref.org/import-export/export/customexports). Some users have created export filters that can be useful to many others.

They are collected at [https://layouts.jabref.org](https://layouts.jabref.org).
