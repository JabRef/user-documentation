# Sharing

## Q: How does JabRef support me in sharing my Bib\(La\)TeX libraries?

A: JabRef automatically recognizes a change in the `bib` file on disk and notifies the user of it. This is cool for network drives.

If you use version control, a few advices are given for a smoother [sharing of a bib file](../collaborative-work/sharedbibfile.md).

In addition, we have [many open issues dealing with collaboration](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/wiki/FeatureRequests-Sorted#allow-me-to-work-with-others-please).

## Q: How to do collaborative work on a library?

A: You can either choose to [use an SQL database](../collaborative-work/sharedbibfile.md) or to [share a bib file](../collaborative-work/sharedbibfile.md).
