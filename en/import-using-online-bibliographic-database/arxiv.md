# Fetching entries from arXiv

[ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/) is a repository of scientific preprints in the fields of mathematics, physics, astronomy, computer science, quantitative biology, statistics, and quantitative finance \([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ArXiv)\).

To fetch entries from arXiv, choose **Search → Web search**, and the search interface will appear in the side pane. Select **ArXiv.org** in the dropdown menu. Enter the words of your query, and press Enter or the **Fetch** button.

The results are displayed in the [import inspection window](../import-export/). In case an error occurs, it is shown in a popup.
