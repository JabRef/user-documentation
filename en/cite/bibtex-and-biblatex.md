# BibTeX and BibLaTeX

JabRef is is a program for working with BibTeX and BibLaTeX databases. JabRef program uses no separate internal file format, but directly works with BibTeX and BibLaTeX. That means, your Bib\(La\)TeX file is kept as is when opening in JabRef and saving again: You normally load and save your databases directly in the Bib\(La\)TeX `.bib` format. In addition, you can also [import](../collect/) and export bibliography libraries in a number of other formats into JabRef.

More information on BibTeX is available at [our information page on BibTeX fields](../advanced/fields.md).
