# Export to Microsoft Word

 for a video explaining the usage. You can use the builtin export functionality for Office 2007 xml format,  which is the format in which Microsoft stores it bibliography information.

1. Export \(selected\) entries in JabRef and choose Office 2007 xml format
2. Open Word, click on the References Tab
3. Click on Manage sources -&gt; Browse -&gt; Open the exported XML File \(or better copy it directly to the location under browse\)
4. All entries are then available in the MS bibliography database

For a detailed list of the fields which are exported in the Office 2007 xml format see the following page.

The only problem in the export could be when you have a "company" as author. That is simply exported as author and not in the company field.

Another option is to use [Bibtex4Word](http://www.ee.ic.ac.uk/hp/staff/dmb/perl/index.html). See [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9j3g4wfdM00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9j3g4wfdM00) for a video explaining the usage.
