# Running a local Large Language Model (LLM)

Notice:

1. LLMs require a lot of computational power and therefore lots of electricity.
2. Smaller models typically respond qualitatively worse than bigger ones, but they are faster, need less memory and might already be sufficient for your use case.
3. The size of a model can be measured in number of parameters in its neural network. The "b" in the model name typically stands for **b**illion parameters. It also can be measured in terms of gigabytes required to load the model into your devices RAM/VRAM.
4. The model should always completely fit into VRAM (fast), otherwise layers will be offloaded to RAM (slower) and if it doesn't fit in there either, it will use SSD (abysmally slow).
5. Hardware recommendation for maximize prompt processing and token generation speed: A device with high *bandwidth*. A modern GPU with lots of VRAM will satisfy this requirement best.


## High-level explanation

You can use any program that creates a server with OpenAI-compatible API.

After you started your service, you can do this:

1. The "Chat Model" field in AI preferences is editable, so you can enter any model you have downloaded
2. There is a field called "API base URL" in "Expert Settings" where you need to provide the address of an OpenAI-compatible API server

Voil√†! You can use a local LLM right away in JabRef.

## Step-by-step guide for `ollama`

The following steps guide you on how to use `ollama` to download and run local LLMs.

1. Install `ollama` from [their website](https://ollama.com/download)
2. Select a model that you want to run. The `ollama` provides [a large list of models](https://ollama.com/library) to choose from. Some popular models are for instance [qwen3:30b-a3b](https://ollama.com/library/qwen3), [`granite3.1-moe:3b`](https://ollama.com/library/granite3.1-moe), [`devkit/L1-Qwen-1.5B-Max`](https://ollama.com/devkit/L1-Qwen-1.5B-Max), [`mistral:7b`](https://ollama.com/library/mistral) or [`mistral-small3.1:24b`](https://ollama.com/library/mistral-small3.1).
3. When you have selected your model, type `ollama pull <MODEL>:<PARAMETERS>` in your terminal. `<MODEL>` refers to the model name like `gemma2` or `mistral`, and `<PARAMETERS>` refers to parameters count like `2b` or `9b`.
4. `ollama` will download the model for you
5. After that, you can run ollama serve to start a local web server. This server will accept requests and respond with LLM output. Note: The ollama server may already be running, so do not be alarmed by a cannot bind error. If it is not yet running, use the following command: `ollama run <MODEL>:<PARAMETERS>`
6. Go to JabRef Preferences -> AI
7. Set the "AI provider" to "OpenAI"
8. Set the "Chat Model" to the model you have downloaded in the format `<MODEL>:<PARAMETERS>`
9. Set the "API base URL" in "Expert Settings" to `http://localhost:11434/v1/`

Now, you are all set and can chat "locally".

## Step-by-step guide for GPT4All

The following steps guide you on how to use `GPT4All`to download and run local LLMs.

1. Install `GPT4All`from their [website](https://www.nomic.ai/gpt4all).
2. Open GPT4All, [download a model](https://docs.gpt4all.io/gpt4all_desktop/models.html), configure it in the [settings](https://docs.gpt4all.io/gpt4all_desktop/settings.html) and [run it as a server](https://docs.gpt4all.io/gpt4all_api_server/home.html).
3. Open JabRef, go to "File" > "Preferences" > "AI"
4. Set the "AI provider" to "GPT4All"
5. Set the "Chat model" to the name (including the `.gguf`part) of the model you have downloaded in GPT4All.
6. Set the "API base URL" in "Expert Settings" to `http://localhost:4891/v1/chat/completions`.
