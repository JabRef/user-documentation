# Clean up entries

JabRef can clean up the entries of a library. To do a clean up of the entries, go to **Quality → Clean up entries**. Then select the actions to be carried out.

![The Clean up entries dialog](<../.gitbook/assets/cleanupdialog (5).png>)

under the table`Enable field formatters`. Then, under the table, you can select using 2 drop-down menus:

* an entry field (upon which the action will be applied).
* the type of action to be carried out (such as HTML to LaTeX, which converts HTML code to LaTeX code, as described in the window).​ See the [list of formatting actions](saveactions.md).

A click on the "circular arrow" icon enables a set of recommended formatting actions (the set of actions will depend on your database type: BibTeX or biblatex).
