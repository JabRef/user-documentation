# Cleanup entries

JabRef can cleanup the entries of a database. To do a cleanup of the entries, go to **Quality → Cleanup entries**. Then select the actions to be carried out.

![The Cleanup entries dialog](../.gitbook/assets/cleanupdialog%20%281%29.png)

under the table`Enable field formatters`. Then, under the table, you can select using 2 drop-down menus: 

* an entry field \(upon which the action will be applied\).
* the type of action to be carried out \(such as HTML to LaTeX, which converts HTML code to LaTeX code, as described in the window\).​ See the [list of formatting actions](../advanced/saveactions.md).

A click on the "circular arrow" icon enables a set of recommended formatting actions \(the set of actions will depend on your database type: BibTeX or biblatex\).
