# Best practices

## Helpful groups

* Group for your own papers: `author=YOURSELF`
* Group for the papers of your team: `author=YOURSELF and author=COLLEAGUE1 and author=COLLEAGUE2`

{% page-ref page="groups.md" %}

## Sort order

To make finding an entry easier in a large file, sort your entries by the citation key on save. This can be set in **Library → Library properties**.

{% page-ref page="../setup/databaseproperties.md" %}

## Use integrity check often

Use **Quality -&gt; Check integrity** often to ensure that the quality of your database does not degrade.

{% page-ref page="checkintegrity.md" %}

## Enable save actions

To ensure that your library stays consistent, specify your save actions in  **Library → Library properties**.

{% page-ref page="saveactions.md" %}
