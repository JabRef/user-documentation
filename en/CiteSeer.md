# Fetching entries from CiteSeerX

[CiteSeerX](http://csxstatic.ist.psu.edu/about) is a public search engine for scientific and academic papers primarily with a focus on computer and information science. However, CiteSeerX has been expanding into other scholarly domains such as economics, physics and others ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CiteSeer)). 

To fetch entries from CiteSeerX, choose **Search -&gt; Web search**, and the search interface will appear in the side pane. Select **CiteSeerX** in the dropdown menu. To start a search, enter the words of your query, and press **Enter** or the **Fetch** button.

The results are displayed in the [import inspection window](ImportInspectionDialog).
In case an error occurs, it is shown in a popup.
