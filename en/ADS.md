# Fetching entries from ADS

[ADS (The SAO/NASA Astrophysics Data System)](http://adswww.harvard.edu/) is an online database of over eight million astronomy and physics papers from both peer reviewed and non-peer reviewed sources ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysics_Data_System)). 

To fetch entries from ADS, choose **Search -&gt; Web search**, and the search interface will appear in the side pane. Select **ADS from ADS-DOI** in the dropdown menu. Enter your query, and press **Enter** or the **Fetch** button. 

The results are displayed in the [import inspection window](ImportInspectionDialog).
In case an error occurs, it is shown in a popup.
