# Fetching entries from SAO/NASA Astrophysics Data System

[SAO/NASA Astrophysics Data System](http://www.adsabs.harvard.edu/) is an online database of over eight million astronomy and physics papers from both peer reviewed and non-peer reviewed sources.
Abstracts are available free online for almost all articles, and full scanned articles are available in Graphics Interchange Format (GIF) and Portable Document Format (PDF) for older articles ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysics_Data_System)).

To fetch entries from SAO/NASA Astrophysics Data System, choose **Search -&gt; Web search**, and the search interface will appear in the side pane.
Select **SAO/NASA Astrophysics Data System** in the dropdown menu.
To start a search, enter the words of your query, and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> or the **Fetch** button.

Then, the results are displayed in the [import inspection window](ImportInspectionDialog).
In case an error occurs, it is shown in a popup.

*Apart from fetching entries by using a full search it is also possible to directly create a BibTeX entry using the* ***BibTeX -&gt; New Entry*** *dialog. More details can be found [here](ADStoBibTeX).*
