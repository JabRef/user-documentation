#  Fetching entries from Google Scholar
[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) is a freely accessible database that indexes the full text or metadata of scholarly literature across an array of publishing formats and disciplines. Google Scholar index includes most peer-reviewed online academic journals and books, conference papers, theses and dissertations, preprints, abstracts, technical reports, and other scholarly literature, including court opinions and patents ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Scholar)).

To fetch entries from Google Scholar, choose **Search -&gt; Web search**, and the search interface will appear in the side pane. Select **Google Scholar** in the dropdown menu. To start a search, enter the words of your query, and press **Enter** or the **Fetch** button.

Frequent connections to Google Scholar will cause Google to display a CAPTCHA challenge which JabRef cannot pass. To avoid this, JabRef will for each search display a preview of the first page of entries returned by the server. You can then choose which entries to fetch.
