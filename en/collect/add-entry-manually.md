To add a new entry, select **Library → New entry...**, press `CTRL + N​` or click on the dedicated icon of the toolbar.

Then, from the dialog window, click on the type of the entry you want.

Finally, the [entry editor](../advanced/entryeditor/) opens and let you fill in the various fields.

You can directly create a new entry of a specific entry type by using a keyboard shortcut. We strongly recommend learning the shortcuts for the entry types you use most often, e.g. `Ctrl + Shift + A` for adding an article entry.​ See **Options → Customize key bindings**.
