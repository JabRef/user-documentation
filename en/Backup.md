# Backup

## Purpose

This module is always running in the background while you are working on a _BibTeX database_.
It makes a _backup copy_ and keeps that up-to-date on every user interaction.
For instance, when you change a field the new value would get saved into the backup copy.
 
Assumed that _JabRef_ crashes while you are working on a _BibTeX database_.
When you try again to open the file _JabRef_ crashed with you will get the following dialog:

Now you have the possibility to restore your changes which would normally get lost.

## Remarks

By default this feature is enabled and it is running continuously without users influence.
By using the [gitignore.io](https://www.gitignore.io/) service, you can generate an appropriate `.gitignore` file by opening https://www.gitignore.io/api/jabref.

## Offstage

While opening a `.bib` file, _JabRef_ simoultaneously creates a `.sav` file which is used as a current buffer.
If _JabRef_ gets closed normally the `.sav` file will be removed.
Otherwise this file is going to be used for database restoration next time.
