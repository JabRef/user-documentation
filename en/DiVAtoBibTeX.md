# Creating entries from DiVA

[DiVA (Digitala Vetenskapliga Arkivet)](http://www.diva-portal.org/) is a database with publications from about [40](www.diva-portal.org/smash/aboutdiva.jsf) Swedish universities and research institutions.

To use this feature, choose **BibTeX -&gt; New entry...**.
In the lower part, there is the box "ID-based entry generator".
In the field "ID type", "DiVA" can be selected (see screenshot below).
Select the field "ID" and enter the DiVA here (e.g., `diva2:260746`) and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to generate an entry based on the Id.
You can also click on "Generate".
The found entry is opened in an entry editor.
In case an error occurs, a popup is shown.
