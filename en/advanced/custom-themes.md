# Custom themes

## General

Since `JabRef 5.2` it is possible to use custom themes. In `Preferences > Appearance > Visual theme` the themes in general can be changed. Themes are just [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting\_started\_with\_the\_web/CSS\_basics) files defining the look of the UI.&#x20;

* **Light Theme**: The default theme is the light theme ([`Base.css`](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/main/src/main/java/org/jabref/gui/Base.css)).
* **Dark Theme**: There is an alternative dark theme ([`Dark.css`](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/main/src/main/java/org/jabref/gui/Dark.css)) which is based on `Base.css` and just overwrites the colors.
* **Custom Theme**: In `Preferences > Appearance > Visual theme > Custom theme` there can be set a custom theme by simply selecting a custom CSS (based on `Base.css` or `Dark.css`), for instance:

You can find a collection of user contributed themes at [https://themes.jabref.org](https://themes.jabref.org/).&#x20;

| `{} biblatex source` tab         | `.code-area`       |

## Known bugs

* [#8523](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/8523): On Windows 10, it is not possible to use fonts that were installed user-wide in the CSS, only system-wide fonts are working. A workaround to use fonts that are not installed system-wide is to include the font file via [`@font-face`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@font-face).
