# Best Practices

## Helpful groups

* Group for your own papers: `author=YOURSELF`
* Group for the papers of your team: `author=YOURSELF and author=COLLEAGUE1 and author=COLLEAGUE2`

See [Groups](../finding-sorting-and-cleaning-entries/groups.md).

## Sort order

 To make finding an entry easier in a large file, sort your entries by the citation key on save. This can be set in **Library → Library properties**.

See [Library properties window](../setup/databaseproperties.md).

## Use integrity check often

Use **Quality -&gt; Check integrity** often to ensure that the quality of your database does not degrade.

See [Check Integrity](../finding-sorting-and-cleaning-entries/checkintegrity.md).

## Enable save actions

To ensure that your BibTeX file look consistent,  specify your save actions in  **Library → Library properties**.

See [Save Actions](../finding-sorting-and-cleaning-entries/saveactions.md).
