## JabRef-compatible text editors

JabRef can push entries, i.e., insert `\cite{key}` commands, to the following text editors:

* [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)
* [LyX/Kile](http://www.lyx.org/)
* [TeXstudio](http://www.texstudio.org/)
* [Texmaker](http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/)
* [Vim](http://www.vim.org/)

Additionally, JabRef can natively insert citations and format a bibliography in:

* [OpenOffice Writer](https://www.openoffice.org/)
* [LibreOffice Writer](https://www.libreoffice.org/)

See [OpenOffice/LibreOffice integration](https://docs.jabref.org/import-export/other-integrations/openofficeintegration) for details.

## JabRef journal abbreviation lists

JabRef can help you refactor your reference list by automatically abbreviating or unabbreviating journal names, as explained in [the dedicated help](https://docs.jabref.org/fields/journalabbreviations).

Although JabRef comes with a build-in list of journals, additional lists are available at [https://abbrv.jabref.org](https://abbrv.jabref.org).

## Export filters

JabRef allows you to create custom export filters. This functionality and the installation procedure are described in the help file on [Custom export filters](https://docs.jabref.org/import-export/export/customexports). Some users have created export filters that can be useful to many others.

They are collected at [https://layouts.jabref.org](https://layouts.jabref.org).

### Endnote export filter set

This improves author recognition and adds support for more fileds to EndNote.

### Export-Filter Editor

Using this tool you can easily create a custom export filter for JabRef to build you own bibliography style.

## Additional tools

### BibSync

[BibSync](https://github.com/minad/bibsync) is a tool to synchronize your paper database with a BibTeX file which might be most useful for Physicists and Mathematicians since it supports synchronization with DOI and arXiv.

### Bibtex4word

[Bibtex4Word](http://www.ee.ic.ac.uk/hp/staff/dmb/perl/index.html) is an add-in for Microsoft Word that allows the citation of references and the insertion of a bibliography into your document using your choice of formatting style. It is lightweight, transparent and does not mess up your documents.

### Library

[Library](https://github.com/cgogolin/library) is an Open Source Android application to view BibTeX files in order to open \(and annotate\) linked PDFs. It also supports opening DOIs as well as sharing entries. Furthermore it is possible to filter entries and sort them by date, journal, author and title. There are no editing capabilities though.

Library is available from [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.cgogolin.library/) and [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cgogolin.library).

### Eratosthenes Reference Manager

Available for Android 4.0 and up.

Unfortunately, this application is not available anymore from Google Play and must be [build on your own from source](https://bitbucket.org/mkmatlock/eratosthenes/).

### Feinerleiser
