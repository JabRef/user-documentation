# Field content selector

The preferences for this feature are accessible via **Library → Library properties → Content selectors** and allows you to store often-used words or phrases. This creates the possibility to conveniently make use of them in the entry editor to fill in field content.

To add a new word by using the content selector in the entry editor, you can simply click into the text box for the field for which you configured the selectors. A drop down menu will appear and you can select the keyword of your choice. This mechanism is based on the [autocompletion](https://docs.jabref.org/advanced/entryeditor#word-name-autocompletion) functionality in JabRef (**File → Preferences → Autocompletion**) . Therefore, you need to have autocompletion enabled in your preferences.

By default, the feature is enabled for the fields _Journal_, _Author_, _Keywords_ and _Publisher_, but you can also add selectors to other fields.

The word selection is library-specific, and is saved along with your references in the .bib file.
