# Send as email

JabRef allows you to send entries to third parties via email.

### How to send as e-mail:

1. Select one or multiple entries
2. Choose **Tools → Send as email** in the menu

This will open your default email application and automatically paste the entries in their raw BibTeX format. Once your correspondents have received the email, they will be able to directly copy and paste the entries into JabRef (or use them in other ways).

### How to attach linked files of entries to your email

Once `Send as email` is pressed, JabRef will also automatically open the folder of attached files, as long as the option `automatically open folders of attached files` is enabled at **File → Preferences → External programs → Sending of emails**. Attaching these files to your email is possible by dragging and dropping the PDF files into your favorite email application.
