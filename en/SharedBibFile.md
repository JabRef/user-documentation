# Sharing a Bib(La)TeX Database

JabRef allows to share both Bib(La)TeX database and [SQL database](SQLDatabase).

When sharing a Bib(La)TeX database, JabRef automatically recognizes a change in the `bib` file on disk and notifies the user of it.
This works well on network drives.

*Note:* the use of a version control system (SVN, git, etc.) is recommended as this will allow for reverting changes.

To make the sharing of a Bib(La)TeX database easier, it is recommended to set specific database properties.
In the menu **File -> database properties**:
- Select `UTF-8` as encoding.
- Define a `General file directory`, which will be used to store shared PDF (and other) files.
- Define a sort order (`year`, `author`, `title` is recommended).
- Check `Refuse to save the database before external changes have been reviewed`.
- Check `Enable save actions`, and defines these actions, to help enforcing a consistent format for the entries.
