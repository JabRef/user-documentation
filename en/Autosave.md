# Autosave

## Purpose

The autosave feature helps to prevent loss of data by saving the opened database on user interactions.
So there is no need to save the database manually after changing it.
Furthermore it synchronizes your local files which are associated with appropriate [SQLDatabase](shared databases).

## Activation

You can activate the autosave feature through **Options -&gt; Preferences**, and then by choosing **File** on the left panel. At the lower part of the window, a section is dedicated to **AutoSave**.


## Autosave for local databases

If you are working on **.bib** files which are located on your file system, the feature will detect your changes automatically and save them without further intervention.

## Autosave for shared databases

Generally you are able to save a shared database after connecting to it. This feature enables a full synchronization of your local bib file with the [SQLDatabase](shared SQLdatabase).

## Remarks

Both features are enabled by default.
