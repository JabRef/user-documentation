Fetching entries using the Digital Object Identifier (DOI)
==========================================================

To use this feature, choose **Search -&gt; Web search**, and the search interface will appear in the side pane. Select **DOI to BibTeX** in the dropdown menu.

This fetcher uses <http://dx.doi.org/> to convert an DOI to a BibTeX entry.

Enter the DOI in the search field and press **Enter** or the **Fetch** button. The entry will be fetched and added to your currently active database. In case an error occurs, it is shown in a popup.
