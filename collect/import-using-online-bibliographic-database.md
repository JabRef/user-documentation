# Searching externally using Online Services

JabRef is not intended to be a tool for mass download of citations. The purpose of the Web search is to easily gather a few entries directly from within JabRef. If you use the search functionality too extensively you might get blocked (for some time). To fetch entries from an online database, choose **View → Web search**, and the search interface will appear in the side panel. Select the database you want to search (e.g., arXiv) in the dropdown menu. Note that it might be necessary to scroll downwards to find certain fetchers. An example for this is provided in the image below. You may opt to download the abstracts along with the cite information for each entry, by checking the **Include abstracts** checkbox.Then enter the words of your query, and press Enter, or the **Search** button. The results are displayed in the [import inspection dialog](import/importinspectiondialog.md). Some online services support advanced search queries. These are described below at the respective fetcher.

![JabRefWebSearch](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6931104/199564571-2287248b-40ac-4089-9af7-9feda25744b7.png)

Apart from fetching entries by using a full search, it is also possible to directly [create an entry using a unique identifier](add-entry-using-an-id.md).

## Mass downloading of articles

However, it is still possible to import hundreds or even thousands of entries from these databases. The process depends a bit on the specifics of each database, but in general works as follows: Search the database in your browser, export the result in one of the supported file formats and then [import the file into JabRef](import/).

## Using a Proxy Server

If you need to use an HTTP proxy server, you can configure JabRef to use a proxy using the "Network" preferences (**File → Preferences → Network**).

## Search Syntax

Since version [5.2](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#52--2020-12-24):

JabRef searches the databases by using the specified keywords. One can use quotes (`"`) to keep words togehter: An example is `"process mining"`. It is also possible to restrict the search to dedicated fields:

Thereby, JabRef supports following fields:

| field        | meaning                                                   |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `author`     | The author of the work                                    |
| `title`      | The title of the work                                     |
| `journal`    | The title of the journal of the work                      |
| `year`       | The year in which the work was published                  |
| `year-range` | The year range (e.g., `1999-2001`) the work was published |
| `doi`        | The document object identifier of the work                |

One can usually combine different searches using the Boolean operators `AND` and `OR`. Thereby, the default operator is `OR`.

### Examples

* `author:smith and author:jones`: search for references with authors "smith" and "jones"
* `author:smith or author:jones`: search for references with either author "smith" or author "jones"
* `author:smith and not title:processor`: search for author "smith" and omit references with "processor" in the title

Technial note: The search syntax is adapted from [Apache Lucene](https://lucene.apache.org/core/2\_9\_4/queryparsersyntax.html). JabRef takes the Lucene syntax and transforms it to the syntax required by the supported databases.

## Supported databases

### ACM Portal

The [ACM Portal](https://dl.acm.org) includes two databases ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association\_for\_Computing\_Machinery#Portal\_and\_Digital\_Library)):

* the **ACM Digital Library** is a text collection of every article published by the [Association for Computing Machinery](https://www.acm.org), including over 60 years of archives from articles, magazines and conference proceedings.
* the **Guide to Computing Literature** that is a bibliographic collection from major publishers in computing with over one million entries.

### Bibliotheksverbund Bayern (BVB)

The [Bibliotheksverbund Bayern (BVB)](https://bib-bvb.de) provides bibliographic information from all public libraries in Bavaria, Germany. The format used is [MarcXML](https://www.loc.gov/marc/bibliographic/), [which has been modified](https://www.bib-bvb.de/documents/10792/9f51a033-5ca1-42e2-b2d3-a75e7f1512d4), which in turn is [based on other modifications](https://www.dnb.de/marc21).

### Biodiversity Heritage Library

[Biodiversity Heritage Library](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/) makes biodiversity literature openly available to the world as part of a global biodiversity community. It is the world’s largest open access digital library for biodiversity literature and archives ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiversity\_Heritage\_Library)).

### CiteSeerX

[CiteSeerX](https://csxstatic.ist.psu.edu/home) is a public search engine for scientific and academic papers primarily with a focus on computer and information science. However, CiteSeerX has been expanding into other scholarly domains such as economics, physics, and others ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CiteSeer)).

### Collection of Computer Science Bibliographies (CCSB)

The [Collection of Computer Science Bibliographies](https://liinwww.ira.uka.de/bibliography/) is a public search engine for bibliographies of scientific literature in computer science.

### Crossref / Unpaywalll

[Unpaywall](https://unpaywall.org) is an open database with over 20 million free scholarly articles harvested from over 50,000 journals and open-access repositories around the globe. Sources for these articles include repositories run by renowned universities, governments, and scholarly societies. Unpaywall is integrated into thousands of existing search engines, library platforms, and information products, making articles easy to find, track, and use for your scholarly communication needs.

The Unpaywall database has a very simple structure: it has one record for each article with a Crossref DOI. It harvests from many sources to find Open Access content, and then matches this content to these DOIs using content fingerprints. So for any given DOI, we know about any OA versions that exist anywhere.

To fetch entries from Unpaywall indirectly through Crossref, choose **Search → Web search**, and the search interface will appear in the side pane. Select **Crossref** in the dropdown menu. To start a search, enter the words of your query, and press Enter or the **Fetch** button.

### DBLP

[DBLP](https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/) is a computer science bibliography website listing more than 3.1 million journal articles, conference papers, and other publications on computer science ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBLP)).

### DOAB

[DOAB (Directory of Open Access Books)](https://doabooks.org) is is a community-driven discovery service that indexes and provides access to scholarly, peer-reviewed open access books and helps users to find trusted open access book publishers.

### DOAJ

[DOAJ (Directory of Open Access Journals)](https://doaj.org) is a database covering more than 10000 open access journals covering all areas of science, technology, medicine, social science, and humanities ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directory\_of\_Open\_Access\_Journals)).

It is possible to limit the search by adding a field name to the search, as **field:text**. The supported fields are:

| key         | description                  |
| ----------- | ---------------------------- |
| `title`     | The title of the article     |
| `doi`       | The DOI of the article       |
| `issn`      | The ISSN of the journal      |
| `publisher` | The publisher of the journal |
| `abstract`  | The abstract of the article  |

### Google Scholar

{% hint style="warning" %}
Currently not working, because Google changed their API
{% endhint %}

[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com) is a freely accessible database that indexes the full text or metadata of scholarly literature across an array of publishing formats and disciplines. Google Scholar index includes most peer-reviewed online academic journals and books, conference papers, theses and dissertations, preprints, abstracts, technical reports, and other scholarly literature, including court opinions and patents ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google\_Scholar)).

#### Traffic limitations

Google scholar can block "automated" crawls which generate too much traffic in a short time. To unblock your IP, doing a Google scholar search in your browser might help. You will be asked to show that you are not a robot (a CAPTCHA challenge). If no CAPTCHA appears, or JabRef is still blocked after performing a search in the browser, you can also change your IP address manually or wait for some hours to get unblocked again.

Thus, the Google Scholar fetcher is not the best way to obtain lots of entries at the same time. The [JabRef browser extension](jabref-browser-extension.md) might be an alternative to download the bibliographic data directly from the browser.

### GVK

[GVK](https://gso.gbv.de), the GBV Union Catalogue, is a multimaterial bibliographic database of seven German federal states. It covers 41.5 million records of books, conference proceedings, periodicals, dissertations, microfilms and electronic resources.

#### Advanced search

You can simply enter words / names / years you want to search for, or you can specify search fields.

Supported fields are:

| field     | description                                                       |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `all`     | all words. Not specifYing a search key results in an "all" search |
| `title`   | title words (converted to GVK's `tit` field)                      |
| `author`  | Searches author, editors, etc. (converted to GVK's `per` field)   |

| `bkl`     | Basisklassifikation-numbers                                       |

Year ranges are not supported. In case a year range is provided, it is ignored. Otherwise, GVK returns no results.

#### Notes

* queries can be combined with `and`. The use of `and` is optional, though.
* in many cases you can use the truncation sign `?`
* spaces in person names are not supported yet. Please use the truncation sign `?` after the first name for several given names. E.g. `per Maas,jan?`

#### Sample queries

* `marx kapital`
* `author:grodke and title:db2`
* `author:"Maas,jan?"`

### IEEEXplore

IEEEXplore comprises over 180 journals, over 1,400 conference proceedings, more than 3,800 technical standards, over 1,800 eBooks and over 400 educational courses ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE\_Xplore))

### INSPIRE

[INSPIRE-HEP](https://inspirehep.net/?ln=en) is an open access digital library for the field of high energy physics ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INSPIRE-HEP)).

#### Query syntax

The INSPIRE-HEP search function merely passes your search queries onto the INSPIRE-HEP web search, so you should build your queries in the same way. INSPIRE supports the fielded search too. See [https://inspirehep.net/help/knowledge-base/inspire-paper-search/](https://inspirehep.net/help/knowledge-base/inspire-paper-search/) for advanced help.

The following list shows some of the field indicators that can be used:

### Jstor

{% hint style="warning" %}
Currently disabled because of traffic limit
{% endhint %}

[Jstor](https://jstor.org) is an online database with access to more than 12 million journal articles, books, and sources in 75 disciplines. [About](https://about.jstor.org)

It is possible to limit the search by adding a field name to the search, such as `field:"text"`. The supported fields are:

* `title`: The title of the article
* `author`: an author of the article
* `journal`: journal title (sent as `pt` to Jstor)
* `pt`: publication title

### MathSciNet

[MathSciNet](https://www.ams.org/mathscinet/) is a searchable online bibliographic database. It contains all of the contents of the journal Mathematical Reviews (MR) since 1940 along with an extensive author database, links to other MR entries, citations, full journal entries, and links to original articles. It contains almost 3 million items and over 1.7 million links to original articles ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MathSciNet)).

### Medline/PubMed

[MEDLINE](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/pmresources.html) is a bibliographic database of life sciences and biomedical information. It includes bibliographic information for articles from academic journals covering medicine, nursing, pharmacy, dentistry, veterinary medicine, and health care. MEDLINE also covers much of the literature in biology and biochemistry, as well as fields such as molecular evolution ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEDLINE)).

The Medline syntax is completely different form the Lucene syntax. One cannot use fielded search there.

There are two ways of specifying which entries to download:

1. Enter one or more MEDLINE IDs (separated by comma/semicolon) in the text field.
2. Enter a set of names and/or words to search for. You can use the operators `and` and `or` and parentheses to refine your search expression. See [OVID operators](https://resourcecenter.ovid.com/site/help/documentation/ospa/en/Content/syntax.htm) for full description.

#### Examples

* `May \[au\] AND Anderson \[au\]`
* `Anderson RM \[au\] HIV \[ti\]`
* `Valleron \[au\] 1988:2000\[dp\] HIV \[ti\]`
* `Valleron \[au\] AND 1987:2000\[dp\] AND (AIDS \[ti\] OR HIV\[ti\])`
* `Anderson \[au\] AND Nature \[ta\]`
* `Population \[ta\]`

### SAO/NASA Astrophysics Data System

[SAO/NASA Astrophysics Data System](https://www.adsabs.harvard.edu) is an online database of over eight million astronomy and physics papers from both peer-reviewed and non-peer-reviewed sources. Abstracts are available free online for almost all articles, and full scanned articles are available in Graphics Interchange Format (GIF) and Portable Document Format (PDF) for older articles ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysics\_Data\_System)).

### SearchAll

### Semantic Scholar

[Semantic Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/) is a free, AI-powered, research tool for scientific literature. Developed at the Allen Institute for AI, it uses advances in natural language processing to provide summaries for scholarly papers ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic\_Scholar)).

### Springer

[Springer](https://www.springer.com) (aka Springer Science+Business Media) is a global publishing company that publishes books, e-books, and peer-reviewed journals in science, technical and medical publishing. Springer also hosts a number of scientific databases, including SpringerLink, Springer Protocols, and SpringerImages ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Springer\_Science%2BBusiness\_Media)).

### zbMATH Open

[zbMATH Open](https://zbmath.org) is an abstracting and reviewing service in pure and applied mathematics. Its database contains about 4 million bibliographic entries with reviews or abstracts currently drawn from about 3,000 journals and book series, and 180,000 books. The coverage starts in the 18th century and is complete from 1868 to the present by the integration of the "Jahrbuch über die Fortschritte der Mathematik" database ([about](https://zbmath.org/about/)).

#### Structured Search

You cannot use the same query syntax as in the one-line search at zbmath.org; you have to stick with the Apache Lucence syntax. This means that your query can be composed of several terms, combined by the logical operators `AND` and `OR`. Queries are case-insensitive. Further operators that can be used are `NOT` for logical negation, `*` for a right wildcard, `" "` for exact phrase matches, and parentheses `( )` to group terms. Optionally, it is possible to add a field name in the form field:text to limit the search results. The supported fields are:

| field       | description                                                                                           |
