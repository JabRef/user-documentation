## Script overview

The script `automate.py` has following commands available (each can be shown when called with the help parameter `-h` on any of the positional parameters):

- `$ python _scripts/automate.py status [-e|--extended] [-m --markdown]`
  - prints the current status to the console
  - `[-e|--extended]` prints the relevant pages (also applies to the markdown mode)
  - `[-m --markdown]` write the status int the markdown syntax and opens the file

- `$ python _scripts/automate.py update [-e|--extended]`
  - updates all the redirecting pages and the index file of each language as well as the include pages
  - `[-e|--extended]` prints the relevant pages

- `$ python _scripts/automate.py clean [-e|--extended]`
  - removes all the generated pages, the help site may not work afterwards
  - `[-e|--extended]` prints the deleted pages

- `$ python _scripts/automate.py removeHelpSuffix [-e|--extended]`
  - removes from all help pages the `Help` suffix and creates redirects for them, this gets also called on each `update`
  - `[-e|--extended]` prints the renamed pages

## Installation notes

### Windows

1. Open cmd.exe with administrative privileges
2. [Install Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install)

For using `automate.py`:

1. `choco install python2`
2. Switch back to normal command prompt
3. `c:\tools\python2\Scripts\pip install python-frontmatter`

For using Jekyll:

1. `choco install ruby --version 2.4.3.1`. `choco pin add -n ruby`. - install Ruby 2.4 as version 2.5 is currently not supported by Jekyll's gem bundle
2. `refreshenv` - to have ridk in the path
3. `ridk install` - to start installing Ruby Development Kit
4. Choose option 3
5. Now, `bundle install` should succeed.

In case Jekyll plugins are required, do these steps [[source](http://blog.cloud-mes.com/2014/08/19/how-to-install-gem-curb-in-windows/), linked from <https://github.com/benbalter/jekyll-remote-theme/issues/17#issuecomment-350818119>]:

1. Download [curl-7.40.0-devel-mingw64.zip](https://curl.haxx.se/gknw.net/7.40.0/dist-w64/curl-7.40.0-devel-mingw64.zip)
2. Extract `curl-7.40.0-devel-mingw64.zip` to `c:\temp\curl-7.40.0-devel-mingw64`
3. Run `gem install curb --platform=ruby -- --with-curl-lib=C:/temp/curl-7.40.0-devel-mingw64/bin --with-curl-include=C:/temp/curl-7.40.0-devel-mingw64/include`
4. Alternative to step 4: Copy `libcurl.dll` to `c:\tools\ruby24\bin` [[source](https://stackoverflow.com/a/47754520/873282)]

Note: On windows, this works with [RubyInstaller](http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads), version 2.4.
This installer is used when using chocolatey.
The separate [Development Kit](https://github.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller/wiki/Development-Kit) installer is not required anymore.
[JRuby](http://jruby.org/) doesn't work as the [C extensions were dropped](http://stackoverflow.com/a/32135381/873282).
