# Creating entries using the Digital Object Identifier (DOI)

To use this feature, choose **BibTeX â†’ New entry...**. In the lower part, there is the box "ID-based entry generator". In the field "ID type", "DOI" should be already selected. The field "ID" is focused. Enter the DOI here and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to generate an entry based on the Id. You can also click on "Generate". Then, <http://dx.doi.org/> (provided by <http://crossref.org/>) is used to convert the given DOI to a BibTeX entry. The found entry is opened in an entry editor. In case an error occurs, a popup is shown.
