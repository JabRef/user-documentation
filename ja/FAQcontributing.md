## I am not a programmer

### I would like to improve the help page. What are the steps?

Please follow our [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/JabRef/help.jabref.org/blob/gh-pages/CONTRIBUTING.md) file.

### I would like to help translating JabRef to another language. How do I get started?

We encourage you to read about [translating JabRef](TranslatingGUI).

### I want to keep Wikipedia pages up-to-date

JabRef improves -- and Wikipedia pages should keep up!

Simply click on "Edit" (top right-hand tab).

Currently existing pages are:

- Deutsch: <https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/JabRef>
- English: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JabRef>
- Español: <https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/JabRef>
- Français: <https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/JabRef>
- Italiano: <https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/JabRef>
- Русский: <https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/JabRef>
- Svenska: <https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/JabRef>
- Українська: <https://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/JabRef>
- 中文: <https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/JabRef>

If there is no page for you own language, you can easily create one.
