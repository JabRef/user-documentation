# The Bibtex / Biblatex source tab

## What function fulfills the biblatex source tab?

The biblatex source tab allows you to add and edit BibTeX entries by simply typing the desired content using correct BibTeX syntax. Advanced users may at times find this to be the speedier option. The required syntax is extensively described in ["About BibTeX and its fields"](../fields.md).

Additionally, here the data is shown "as is", which means special symbols that are usually supposed to be hidden or translated into readable form, may show regardless.
