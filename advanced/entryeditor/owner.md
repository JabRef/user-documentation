# The 'owner' field

JabRef can optionally mark all new entries added or imported to a library with your username.

You can disable or enable this feature by entering **Options → Preferences → General**, and selecting/deselecting the line _'mark new entries with owner name'_. You can also change the name used to mark entries. By default, your user name is used. Finally, if an entry with an existing field '_owner_' is imported, the field is updated with your name if _'Overwrite'_ is checked.

The owner name is added in a field called _'owner'_, which by default is visible in the **General fields** tab in the [entry editor](./).
