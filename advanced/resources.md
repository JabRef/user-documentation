## JabRef-compatible text editors

JabRef can push entries, i.e., insert `\cite{key}` commands, to the following text editors:

* [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)
* [LyX/Kile](http://www.lyx.org/)
* [TeXstudio](http://www.texstudio.org/)
* [Texmaker](http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/)

Additionally, JabRef can natively insert citations and format a bibliography in:

* [OpenOffice Writer](https://www.openoffice.org/)
* [LibreOffice Writer](https://www.libreoffice.org/)

See [OpenOffice/LibreOffice integration](https://docs.jabref.org/import-export/other-integrations/openofficeintegration) for details.

## JabRef journal abbreviation lists

JabRef can help you refactor your reference list by automatically abbreviating or unabbreviating journal names, as explained in [the dedicated help](https://docs.jabref.org/fields/journalabbreviations).

Although JabRef comes with a build-in list of journals, additional lists are available at [https://abbrv.jabref.org](https://abbrv.jabref.org).

## Export filters and style files for LibreOffice

JabRef allows you to create custom export filters and style files for LibreOffice. This functionality and the installation procedure are described in the help file on [Custom export filters](https://docs.jabref.org/import-export/export/customexports). Some users have created export filters that can be useful to many others.

Export filters are collected at [https://layouts.jabref.org](https://layouts.jabref.org). Style files for LibreOffice are available at [https://jstyles.jabref.org](https://jstyles.jabref.org).

## Additional tools

### BibSync
