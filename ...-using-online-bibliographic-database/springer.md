# Fetching entries from Springer

[Springer](https://www.springer.com/) \(aka Springer Science+Business Media\) is a global publishing company that publishes books, e-books and peer-reviewed journals in science, technical and medical publishing. Springer also hosts a number of scientific databases, including SpringerLink, Springer Protocols, and SpringerImages \([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Springer_Science%2BBusiness_Media)\).

To fetch entries from Springer, choose **Search → Web search**, and the search interface will appear in the side pane. Select **Springer** in the dropdown menu. To start a search, enter the words of your query, and press Enter or the **Fetch** button.

The results are displayed in the [import inspection window](https://github.com/JabRef/help.jabref.org/tree/1f58696d9081b60bf60823090c7594d67d7f5295/en/ImportInspectionDialog/README.md). In case an error occurs, it is shown in a popup.
