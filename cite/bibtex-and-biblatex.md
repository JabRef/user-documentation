# BibTeX and biblatex

JabRef is is a program for working with BibTeX and biblatex databases. JabRef program uses no separate internal file format but directly works with BibTeX and biblatex. That means, your BibTeX/biblatex file is kept as is when opening in JabRef and saving again: You normally load and save your databases directly in the BibTeX/biblatex`.bib` format. In addition, you can also [import](../collect/) and export bibliography libraries in a number of other formats into JabRef.

More information on BibTeX is available on [our information page on BibTeX fields](../advanced/fields.md).
