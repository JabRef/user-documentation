# The 'owner' field

JabRef can optionally mark all new entries added or imported to a database with your username.

You can disable or enable this feature by entering **Preferences â†’ General**, and selecting/deselecting the line *'mark new entries with owner name'*. You can also change the name used to mark your entries. The default name used is your user name. Finally, if an entry with a field owner is pasted or imported, the field is updated with your owner name if *'Overwrite'* is checked.

The owner name is added in a field called *'owner'*, which by default is visible in the **General fields** tab in the [entry editor](EntryEditor).
