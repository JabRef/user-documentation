# ScienceDirect search

To use this feature, choose **Search -&gt; Web search**, and the search interface will appear in the side pane. Select **ScienceDirect** in the dropdown menu.

The ScienceDirect search relies on the BibSonomy scraper project (http://scraper.bibsonomy.org/) to extract information from the ScienceDirect web page.

This fetcher attempts to run a quick search in the ScienceDirect web site, resulting in up to 100 hits. All hits are then imported.

The results are displayed in the [import inspection window](ImportInspectionDialog).
In case an error occurs, it is shown in a popup.
