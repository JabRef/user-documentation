# Fetching entries from ACM Portal

The [ACM Portal](https://dl.acm.org) includes two databases ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_for_Computing_Machinery#Portal_and_Digital_Library)): - the **ACM Digital Library** that is a full text collection of every article published by the [Association for Computing Machinery](https://www.acm.org), including over 60 years of archives from articles, magazines and conference proceedings. - the **Guide to Computing Literature** that is a bibliographic collection from major publishers in computing with over one million entries.

To fetch entries from ACM, choose **Search â†’ Web search**, and the search interface will appear in the side pane. Select **ACM portal** in the dropdown menu. You may choose which database to search and you may opt to download the abstracts along with the cite information for each entry, by checking the **Include abstracts** checkbox. To start a search, enter the words of your query, and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> or the **Fetch** button.

Frequent connections to ACM Portal may get your IP banned for hours. To avoid this, JabRef will for each search display a preview of the first page of entries returned by the server. You can then choose which entries to download.

Then, the results are displayed in the [import inspection window](ImportInspectionDialog).
